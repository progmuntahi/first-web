                <p>Quality customer service is fundamental to the long-term success of any business. 
                    Customers donâ€™t just equate to sales. They are also one of your best bets in spreading
                     the word about your services or products. When it comes to your website, providing good
                      support fosters your relationship with your customers and helps you grow your customer
                       base. One of the challenges customers face in online shopping is being disconnected 
                       from a personnel who can answer their questions precisely and promptly. Businesses
                        can mitigate this matter by providing an engaging experience for customers using live
                         chat software.
